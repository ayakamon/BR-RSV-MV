## Overview of the code files in src folder

## 0) main.R
* main.R is the script to run.

### 1) ve_fit.R
* Codes to esimate waning protection of RSVpreF during infancy using the phase 3 trial data (Mujai et al. RSVVW'24).
* Data used are embedded in the codes.

### 2) RSV_burden.R
*  Codes to estimate country-specific RSV-associated deaths with initial input from Koltai M, et al. Estimating the cost-effectiveness of maternal vaccination and monoclonal antibodies for respiratory syncytial virus in Kenya and South Africa. BMC Med. 2023 Mar 31;21(1):120. doi: 10.1186/s12916-023-02806-w. PMID: 37004062; PMCID: PMC10064962.
*  Data used are Koltai_figure_2B.csv

### 3) nmr.R
* Codes to estimate gestaional age-specific neonatal mortality in South Africa.
* Dammy data are embeded in the codes.

### 4) ptb_posterior.R
* Codes to obtain posterior samples of gestational ages in South African compornent of the phase 3 trial by trial arm.
* Data used are data/GA_birth_by_week_country.csv

### 4) ptb_posterior_vacc.R
* Codes to obtain posterior samples of gestational ages in South African compornent of the phase 3 trial by trial arm using data for infants born to mothers vaccinated at 27-36 weeks.
* Data used are data/GA_birth_by_week_country_vacc_window.csv
